# TODO:

- manage timeout for gh cli

# STUDY:

* passphrase GPG -> should I study it again ?
* github vs gitlab: Is this easily possible to change github with gitlab ?
* gopass backend -> not fully supported by Ansible but more feature than `pass` and actively maintained
* secrets/rotate: probably not interesting to implement
* submit a PR instead of PUSH
* choose a maintainable file structure
* possibility to encrypt pipeline password input with a gpg key (different of password-store) shared between user and gitlab
* possibility to encrypt with several GPG keys or encrypt some directories with a GPG key and other directories with other keys
